Shape swap
By David Danford and Carl Blum

To run the program, run the ShapeSwap directory through the Virtual Machine Emulator.
The user will be presented with a screen with an 8x8 board of four random shapes.
The goal of the user is to swap pieces around to form chains of 3, 4, or 5 of the same shape
in a row.
To move the player cursor around the board, use the arrow keys.
To swap a piece, press the spacebar, then press the arrow key in the direction you want to swap
or press any other key to escape the swap

Matching 3 in a row gives the player 1 point
Matching 4 in a row gives the player 3 points
Matching 5 in a row gives the player 5 points
Swapping two pieces that don't create a chain penalizes the player 1 point but keeps the swap

There is no win condition, and allowing the player to swap any two pieces allows the game to
go on forever.
